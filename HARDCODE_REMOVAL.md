# Hardcoded Data Removal - Complete

## Overview

Successfully removed ALL hardcoded transactions and investments from the application. The app now uses real-time data from the Supabase database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Transactions Page (`src/app/transactions/page.tsx`)

**What Was Changed:**

- ❌ Removed 15 hardcoded Transaction objects (lines 23-201)
- ✅ Added Supabase query to fetch real transactions from database
- ✅ Joined `transactions` with `investments` table to get company names and types
- ✅ Transformed database results to match Transaction interface
- ✅ Stats calculations now use real data (totalInvested, totalRealized, totalSold)

**Database Query:**

```typescript
const { data: dbTransactions } = await supabase
  .from('transactions')
  .select(
    `
    id,
    transaction_type,
    quantity,
    price,
    total_amount,
    transaction_date,
    notes,
    investments (
      id,
      investment_type,
      symbol,
      company_name
    )
  `
  )
  .order('transaction_date', { ascending: false });
```

### 2. Dashboard Page (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)

**What Was Changed:**

- ❌ Removed 6 hardcoded investment objects (Stocks, Mutual Funds, ETFs, FDs, NPS, EPF)
- ✅ Added Supabase query to fetch real investments from database
- ✅ Created investment type configuration with icons and colors for all 10 types
- ✅ Grouped investments by type and calculated real totals
- ✅ Calculate change and change percentage based on actual data
- ✅ Added empty state UI when no investments exist

**Investment Types Supported:**

1. Stocks (Electric Blue #4D79FF)
2. Mutual Funds (Vibrant Teal #1DD1A1)
3. ETFs (Coral Pink #FF6B6B)
4. Fixed Deposits (Sunny Yellow #FFD93D)
5. NPS (Violet #A78BFA)
6. EPF (Green #34D399)
7. Real Estate (Amber #F59E0B)
8. Gold (Yellow #FBBF24)
9. Bonds (Purple #8B5CF6)
10. Other (Gray #6B7280)

**Database Query:**

```typescript
const { data: dbInvestments } = await supabase
  .from('investments')
  .select('*')
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
```

### 3. Empty States Added

**Dashboard Empty State:**

- Shows when user has no investments
- Displays large icon, message, and "Add Investment" button
- Styled with gradient background and dashed border

**Transactions Table:**

- Already had empty state implemented
- Shows "No transactions found" message with filter adjustment hint

## Database Schema Requirements

### Tables Used:

1. **investments**
   - Fields: id, investment_type, company_name, symbol, current_value, total_invested, created_at
   - Used for: Dashboard investment cards, portfolio calculations

2. **transactions**
   - Fields: id, transaction_type, quantity, price, total_amount, transaction_date, notes
   - Used for: Transaction history, stats calculations

3. **portfolios**
   - Referenced through investments table via portfolio_id

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Remove hardcoded data - **COMPLETED**
2. ⏳ Test with real user data
3. ⏳ Connect NSE API for live stock prices
4. ⏳ Implement real-time price updates
5. ⏳ Add portfolio performance charts with historical data
6. ⏳ Calculate unrealized P&L for active holdings
